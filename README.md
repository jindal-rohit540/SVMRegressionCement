# SVMRegressionCement
Important Industry Problem in Civil Engineering. Predicting the 28 day strength of Concrete.

### Our data set consists of various cement properties and the resulting slump test metrics in cm. Later on the set concrete is tested for its compressive strength 28 days later.

Input variables (7)(component kg in one M^3 concrete):

Cement
Slag
Fly ash
Water
SP
Coarse Aggr.
Fine Aggr.
Output variables (3):

SLUMP (cm)
FLOW (cm)
28-day Compressive Strength (Mpa)
