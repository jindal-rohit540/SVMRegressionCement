Important Industry Problem in Civil Engineering. Predicting the 28 day strength of Concrete.

### Our data set consists of various cement properties and the resulting slump test metrics in cm. Later on the set concrete is tested for its compressive strength 28 days later.

### Input variables (7)(component kg in one M^3 concrete):

1. Cement
2. Slag
3, Fly ash
4. Water
5. SP
6. Coarse Aggr.
7. Fine Aggr.

### Output variables (3):

1. SLUMP (cm)
2. FLOW (cm)
3. 28-day Compressive Strength (Mpa)
